# Guidelines for editing and curing the website content
The purpose of this markdown file is to introduce a set of guidelines and How Tos for editing and curing the content of the SpesML project website (cf. https://spesml.github.io). 

## The Github Repository
The website is deployed using an already opened Github Repository and Github Pages. In order to guarantee an error-free deployment of the website, this chapter gives a brief introduction to the used Github repository and its folder structure.  
  
The Github repository that is used for the website files is available through https://github.com/spesml/spesml.github.io and via the branch "gh-pages" (set as default branch). All changes and uploads pushed to this branch are automatically detected and rendered by Github Pages. The deployment on the website usually takes up to 2 minutes.

### Structure of the repository
The repository is splitted in a root directory (the repository itself) and a folder structure. All files already organised in the root directory need to remain in this directory and shall be updated diectly via Github.
